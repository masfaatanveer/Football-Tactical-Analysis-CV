## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Quick Launch

```bash
git clone https://github.com/masfaatanveer/Football-Tactical-Analysis-CV.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run main.py
```

If you download the ZIP, unzip the code ‚Üí install requirements ‚Üí and run the command below:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

The app will launch locally in your browser and show the real-time football analytics dashboard.
